"""CI-side model registry / workflow validator for the comfyui-runtime family.

Reconciles the three diverged template copies onto ltx2's superset
(comfyui-ltx2/tools/validate_models.py), folding in wan's allowlists and
user-supplied warning semantics (comfyui-wan/tools/validate_models.py),
minimax's copy (a strict subset of wan's), and qwen's baked-entry skip plus
flag-to-workflow existence check (.github/workflows/model_validator.py).

Offline checks (always run):
  1. Workflow JSON validity: every <workflows>/**/*.json must parse.
  2. Coverage: every model file a workflow references, in top-level nodes AND
     in definitions.subgraphs[].nodes, is resolved against the registry.
       - basename unknown to the registry (and not in template.json's
         auto_download / image_baked lists): user-supplied WARNING, never a
         failure; the customer provides it via CHECKPOINT_IDS/LORAS_IDS.
       - basename known but the widget value's folder prefix does not match
         the registry subdir: HARD ERROR. ComfyUI resolves a widget value
         relative to the category root, so "vae/foo.safetensors" for a model
         in models/vae/ resolves as models/vae/vae/foo.safetensors and shows
         a paying customer a missing model while the file is on the volume.
  3. Registry schema: url and subdir are required; dest_subdir is REJECTED
     (CONTRACTS.md section 4: dead field, no shims).
  4. template.json (when --template is given): flag "workflows" and "copy"
     entries must exist ("folders" that are missing only warn, matching the
     provisioner, comfyui-wan/src/workflow_provisioner.py:79-81); every
     swap-group profile filename must be a registry key (CONTRACTS.md 5a).
  4a. template.json schema: a strict key allowlist at every level. Every read
     of template.json is a .get() with a default, so an unknown key is
     indistinguishable from an absent one and a typo is silent: measured
     against wan, "folders" -> "folder" copies ZERO workflows, "flags" ->
     "flag" disables the whole template, "extra_models" -> "extra_model"
     drops a model, and all three exit 0 from the provisioner AND from this
     validator (EXECUTION.md E16). Unknown key -> HARD ERROR.

Network checks (skipped with --offline). Never a bare HEAD:
  5. Registry existence.
       - HF resolve URLs (gated or not) are checked against the HF model API
         tree listing (https://huggingface.co/api/models/<repo>/tree/<rev>/<dir>),
         which is public even for gated repos. An unauthenticated HEAD on a
         gated repo answers 401 whether or not the file exists, so it can
         never detect a deleted file; that blind spot let a renamed IC-LoRA
         (LipDub -> DubIt) sit broken while CI stayed green. Repo renames are
         followed and named in the error. A PRIVATE repo does not serve that
         listing unauthenticated, so when HF_TOKEN is set in the environment
         the request carries it as a bearer token (huggingface.co only); with
         no token the failure says so instead of just "could not list".
       - any other URL gets a ranged GET (Range: bytes=0-0, expecting 206
         with Content-Range). Presigned R2/S3 signatures are method-scoped,
         so a HEAD answers 403 on a GET-signed URL.
     A registry URL that does not resolve is a HARD ERROR (exit non-zero).
     Entries with "baked": true are skipped (the file ships in the image).
  6. Size sanity: a remote size under 10 MB is the tell for a model whose
     weights live in a sidecar no workflow references (the real case: a
     420 KB ONNX graph whose 2.5 GB _data.bin is invisible to a parse-derived
     list). WARNING, unless the entry's own min_size_mb vouches for the size
     or another registry entry declares the sidecar via auto_include_with.
     A remote size BELOW the entry's own min_size_mb is a HARD ERROR: the
     downloader would delete and refetch the file on every boot.
